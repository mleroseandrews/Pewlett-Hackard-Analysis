# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
  The main purpose of this project was to use queries to find the employees that may be retiring soon.  The information is broken down by specific departments so a mentor-ship program can be developed to better prepare for the retirement of several employees.  
## Results:
 - Out of the 331,603 employees at the company, 72,458 are eligible for retirement.
 - The Senior Engineer department has the most employees eligible for retirement with 25,916.   The Senior Staff also have a very high number of eligible retirees at 24,926.
 - There are 1549 employees eligible for the mentorship program
 - There are 569 Senior Staff, 501 Engineers, 169 Senior Engineers, 155 Staff, 78 Assistant Engineers & 77 Technique Leaders available for the mentorship program.  

## Summary:
  Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
 - 72,458  roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.  
 - The total number of employees that were eligible for the mentorship program is only 1,549. This means that through the mentorship program, only 2% of the openings will be fulfilled if every employee on that list enters the program.   They will need to query employees born prior to 1965 to add more available employees as mentors.
